# Janson-Shanon histogram from a database of flickr tags

Calculates a distance matrix using the Janson-Shanon algorithm for each tag in the given database (or .csv file) by counting a probability distribution for each tag pair consisting of one tag and each tag from the set of representative tags (tags with a very high occurrence). The ultimate goal is to calculate how similiar and close images are based on their tags.
