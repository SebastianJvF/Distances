# Janson-Shanon histogram from a database of flickr tags

Calculates a distance matrix using the Janson-Shanon algorithm for each tag in the given database (or a .csv file) by calculating the probability distribution for each tag pair consisting of one database tag and each tag from the set of representative tags (tags with a very high occurrence). The ultimate goal is to calculate how similiar and close images are based on their tags.
